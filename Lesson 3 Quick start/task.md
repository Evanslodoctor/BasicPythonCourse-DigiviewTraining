# Task: Introduction to Python Quick Start and Comments

## Objective:
The objective of this task is to introduce you to the basics of Python programming and familiarize yourself with commenting in Python code.

## Task Description:
- You are required to complete the following tasks:

### 1. Create a Python script: hello_world.py
- Write a Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- Include comments explaining what the script does and any relevant details.

### 2. Create a Python script: comments_intro.py
- Write a Python script that contains comments explaining the purpose and usage of single-line and multi-line comments in Python.
- Include examples demonstrating the use of comments to explain code, provide context, and disable code execution.
- Print out a message to confirm successful execution of the script.
- Include comments explaining each section of code and the expected output.

## Submission Guidelines:
1. Create a repository on GitHub named **003-Digiview-Training-Institute-Basic-Python-Programming**.
2. Create a branch named **task/introduction-to-python**.
3. Create a folder named **001-introduction-to-python** in the repository.
4. Place the two Python scripts (**hello_world.py**, **comments_intro.py**) inside the **001-introduction-to-python** folder.
5. Commit your changes and push them to the repository.
6. Submit a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.

### Note:
- Ensure that each Python script includes appropriate comments to explain the code and its functionality.
- Use meaningful variable names and adhere to Python coding conventions.
- Test your scripts to ensure they run without errors.
- Feel free to explore additional Python features beyond the specified tasks to enhance your understanding.
