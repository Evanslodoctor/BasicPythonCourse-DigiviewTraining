# Setting Up GitHub CLI on Windows

GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to work with GitHub directly from your terminal. Here's how to set up GitHub CLI on Windows:

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have administrative privileges on your Windows system.
- Ensure you have a GitHub account. If not, you can sign up for free at [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Installation Steps

1. **Download GitHub CLI Installer:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the [GitHub CLI releases page](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases).
   - Download the latest version of GitHub CLI for Windows by clicking on the appropriate installer file (`.exe`).

2. **Run Installer:**
   - Once the installer is downloaded, locate the file and double-click on it to start the installation process.

3. **Follow Installation Wizard:**
   - Review the license agreement and click "I Agree" to proceed.
   - Choose the installation location or keep the default.
   - Select additional options like creating a desktop shortcut.
   - Click "Install" to start the installation.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - After the installation is complete, you can verify it by opening a command prompt (`cmd`) or PowerShell and typing the following command:
     ```
     gh --version
     ```
   - This command should display the version of GitHub CLI that is installed on your system.

5. **Authentication:**
   - To start using GitHub CLI, you'll need to authenticate with your GitHub account. You can do this by running the following command:
     ```
     gh auth login
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to sign in to your GitHub account using your web browser.

6. **Start Using GitHub CLI:**
   - Once you're authenticated, you can start using GitHub CLI to perform various GitHub operations directly from your terminal, such as creating repositories, managing issues, and more.

That's it! You've successfully set up GitHub CLI on your Windows system and are ready to start using it to interact with GitHub from the command line.

### Generate SSH Key:

If you haven't already, generate an SSH key pair on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Replace "your_email@example.com" with your actual email address.
x

### Add SSH Key to SSH Agent: Start the SSH agent and add your SSH private key to it:

```bash

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Make sure to replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa with the path to your private key if it's located elsewhere.

### Add SSH Key to GitHub:

Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard using the following command:

```bash

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

If you're not on macOS, you might not have pbcopy. You can use cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and then copy the output manually.

Then, go to your GitHub account settings, navigate to SSH and GPG keys, and add a new SSH key. Paste your public key into the provided field.

### Test SSH Connection:

To ensure that everything is set up correctly, test your SSH connection to GitHub:

```bash

ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message indicating successful authentication.

### Configure Git to Use SSH:

Configure Git to use SSH for GitHub repositories. If you have repositories already cloned via HTTPS, you can switch the remote URL to SSH. Inside the repository directory, run:

```bash

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of your repository.

# Configuring Email and Username in Git

To associate your email and username with your Git commits, follow these steps:

## 1. Set Up Email

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

```

# Setting Up Username in Git

To associate your username with your Git commits, follow these steps:

## 1. Set Up Username

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

# Verification of Git Configuration

After configuring your email and username in Git, you may want to verify that the settings are correctly applied. Here's how:

## 1. Verify Email Configuration

To check the email address associated with your Git commits, run the following command in your terminal:

# Setting Up Git Credential Helper

When working with Git over HTTPS, you can set up a credential helper to securely store your credentials. This allows Git to remember your username and password, so you don't have to enter them every time.

## 1. Check Git Version

Ensure you have Git version 1.7.10 or newer, as Git Credential Manager is included starting from this version.

## 2. Configure Git Credential Helper

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

# Push Changes to GitHub Repository Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI (gh) installed, you can easily push changes to your GitHub repository from the command line.

## 1. Authenticate with GitHub

Before pushing changes, ensure you are authenticated with GitHub CLI by running the following command and following the prompts:

```sh
gh auth login
```

# Add changes to the staging area

```bash
git add .
```

# Commit changes with a commit message

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

# Push changes to the remote repository

```bash
gh repo view owner/repo

```
