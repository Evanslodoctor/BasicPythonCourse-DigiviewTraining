# Python Quickstart

Python is an interpreted programming language, which means that as a developer, you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the Python interpreter to be executed.

To run a Python file from the command line, use the following syntax:

```bash
C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py
```
Here, "helloworld.py" is the name of your Python file.

Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, in any text editor:

helloworld.py

```python

print("Hello, World!")

```
Save your file. Then open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

```bash

C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py
```

The output should read:

```bash

Hello, World!
```
Congratulations! You have written and executed your first Python program.

Python Version
To check the Python version, you can import the sys module and print the version:

```python

import sys


print(sys.version)
```
You will learn more about importing modules in our Python Modules chapter.

The Python Command Line
To test a short amount of code in Python, sometimes it's quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. Python can be run as a command line itself.

Type the following on the Windows, Mac, or Linux command line:

```bash

C:\Users\Your Name>python

Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":
```
```bash

C:\Users\Your Name>py
```
From there, you can write any Python code, including our hello world example:

```python

print("Hello, World!")
```
Which will output "Hello, World!" in the command line.

Whenever you are done in the Python command line, you can simply type the following to quit:

```bash

exit()
```
### Here are some key notes summarizing Python's essential features and concepts:

Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line by an interpreter.

Dynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, allowing variables to change types during execution.

Indentation: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, such as loops, functions, and conditional statements.

Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Simple and Readable Syntax: Python's syntax is designed to be straightforward and readable, with clear, concise code.

Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks, reducing the need for external dependencies.

Cross-platform: Python is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring code portability.

High-level Language: Python abstracts many low-level details, enabling developers to focus on problem-solving rather than system complexities.

Large Ecosystem: Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks for various domains, such as web development, data science, and machine learning.

Community Support: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, provide support, and create resources for learning and collaboration.

Open Source: Python is developed under an open-source license, allowing users to freely use, modify, and distribute the language and its implementations.

Multiparadigm: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, functional, and imperative programming styles.

Exception Handling: Python provides robust mechanisms for handling exceptions, allowing developers to gracefully manage errors in their code.

Documentation: Python emphasizes the importance of clear and comprehensive documentation, ensuring that users can easily understand and utilize its features and functionalities.

Versatility: Python is a versatile language suitable for various applications, including web development, automation, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
